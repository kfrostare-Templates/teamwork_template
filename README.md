# Team Ground Rules

### Working as a team
... is amazing and effective so long as everyone's on board with the team priorities. This template is meant to be forked, cloned and altered to each individual team and their needs. The end goal is to have a smooth running project with happy and efficient team players. Let's get started!

### Take time for this
So you've just formed a new team and are super pumped to get started on your new project. That's awesome, but let's first discuss amongst us how we'd like this to go down. This should take no less than 30 minutes for a team of 5 people who has not previously worked together.

##### Define work and make sure you all agree
Example. The work hours are defined as the time during which the entire team will be available to communicate and continuously work on tasks that directly regards this project.

##### Work hours and availability

* Will we work weekdays
* From what time
* To what time
* When do we break for lunch, for how long
* What about regular breaks, for how long
* Overall availability

* Will we work weekends
* From what time
* To what time
* When do we break for lunch, for how long
* What about regular breaks, for how long
* Overall availability

#### Communication
* When will we have scrum meetings and how often
* For how long will the scrum be
* How do we divide the role of scrum master
* When will we check in during the day, who will make sure

#### Pair Programming
* How do we make sure there is good Git ponging
* How do we make sure we write clear commit messages
* What are our rules on branching off
* What are our rules on where to push from/to
* How do we make sure we have a clean naming standard (branches, repos)

#### Pull Requests
* How do we make sure we have clean PR's
* How do we make sure we're ready to merge

#### Accessability
* How will we make sure all team members can access external accounts (semaphore, coveralls, heroku, netlify, pivotal tracker)

## Ground Rules - Summary (example/editable)
### Work hours and availability
This team aims to work weekdays between **09:00** and **17:30** with a one hour lunch break from **12:00 - 13:00**. Coffee breaks are taken at will and as often as needed so long they do not hinder the team reaching it's daily deadlines.

This team aims to work weekends between **10:00** and **16:00** with "screen lunch" meaning we eat while coding. We only take breaks when needed.

### Communication
This team aims to have two daily scrum meetings (outside of the mandatory morning scrum for the entire company) and one team check in on Slack before lunch each day. 

#### The role of scrum master
The role of scrum master will be set to a rolling schedule where we have one appointed scrum master a day. The scrum master is responsible for updating the ReadMe file(s), presenting during company scrum meetings and updating the Pivotal Tracker.

It is also the scrum master's responsibility to make sure the following meetups occur each day:

##### Morning scrum
The first meeting will be **08:45** to **09:00** where we go through the past day's progress, pull requests that needs merging and prepare scrum master for the company morning scrum.

##### Lunch check-in
Before lunch the team will check in on our Slack channel and give a quick (one sentence) report on how they are doing and what they will be doing after lunch.

##### Evening scrum
The last meeting will be at **17:00 - 17:30** where we go through the day, see if there are pull requests that needs merging and update readme files, pivotal trackers and any other outstanding choirs that are at risk of being neglected.

### Pair Programming
##### Sub-teams
The team will divide itself in sub-teams where applicable in order to work more efficiently. Usually there will be one team on the front- and one on the back-end of the application.  

##### Git-ponging
The scrum master will make sure that the Git-ponging is consistent for all sub-teams and will reach out to the teams should there be too few commits or to few that are committing. 

##### Branching standards
During this project there will be no pushing to the Upstream repository, only pulling. We will not make branches out of other branches, all branches will be made out of the development branch. 

##### Naming standards
We will be using snake case for naming branches, and each side (API and Client) will have the same branch names for each feature.

##### Breaks and coding
When a sub-team agrees on taking a break the branch they are working from should not be altered. Coders who wants to keep coding must do so out of another branch or it would defeat the purpose of pair programming and code ownership.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests are to be reviewed manually and by at least two external (not in the sub-team) team members. The review should preferably be held together with on of the owners of said pull request to improve review efficiency.

##### PR- template
The team will make use of the PR- template at the bottom of this file to make sure all pull requests are in scope.

##### PR Checklist 
The team will make use of the below checklist to make sure all pull requests are clean. This checklist should be looked through by the PR's owner(s) before asking team for a review.

* Double check formatting
* Double check naming standards
* Double check functionality for each line of code/check for commented code and spaces/debuggers
* Double check test coverag
* Double check title and user story
* Double check links to user story
* Re-run all tests locally


#### Accessability
The team will post all links to external accounts in the group team channel and make sure to invite team members where applicable.
